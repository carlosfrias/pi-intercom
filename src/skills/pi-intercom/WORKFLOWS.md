**Purpose:** Best practices for using intercom effectively, plus ready-to-use workflow patterns.

## [S-TIGHT]

Use `ask` for blocking workflows (need answer to proceed), `send` for fire-and-forget notifications. Always include reply hints in messages. Name sessions with `/name`. Four workflow patterns: Research→Implementation, Pair Debugging, Progress Reporting, and Long-Running Task with Checkpoints.

---

## Best Practices

### Use `ask` for blocking workflows

When the worker needs information to proceed:

```typescript
// GOOD: Worker blocks until planner responds
const reply = await intercom({
  action: "ask",
  to: "planner",
  message: "API rate limit is 100/min. Should I implement client-side throttling or batching?"
});
// Continue with the answer...
```

### Use `send` for notifications

When you just want to inform:

```typescript
// GOOD: Fire-and-forget notification
intercom({
  action: "send",
  to: "reviewer",
  message: "PR #123 is ready for review. Key changes in auth.ts."
});
// Continue immediately, don't wait
```

### Include reply hints in messages

Make it easy for recipients to respond:

```typescript
// GOOD: Recipient sees exact command to reply
intercom({
  action: "send",
  to: "worker",
  message: `Found the issue in auth.ts:142. Use getUserById() instead of getUser().

Reply with: intercom({ action: "reply", message: "..." })`
});
```

### Name sessions meaningfully

Use `/name` so others can target you easily:

```
/name api-worker
/name frontend-dev
/name planner
```

## Common Workflow: Research → Implementation Handoff

```typescript
// Research session finds relevant code
intercom({
  action: "send",
  to: "impl-session",
  message: "Found the bug. The issue is in validateUser() - it doesn't check for null.",
  attachments: [{
    type: "snippet",
    name: "validate.ts",
    language: "typescript",
    content: `// Line 45-52 - missing null check
function validateUser(user: User) {
  return user.email?.includes("@"); // crashes if user is null
}`
  }]
});
```

## Common Workflow: Pair Debugging

```typescript
// Session A encounters error
intercom({
  action: "ask",
  to: "session-b",
  message: "Getting 'Cannot read property of undefined' at line 78. Can you check if data.users is populated before this call?"
});

// Session B investigates and replies
intercom({
  action: "reply",
  message: "data.users is null. The fetch failed silently. Add error handling in loadUsers()."
});
```

## Common Workflow: Progress Reporting

```typescript
// Worker sends periodic updates
intercom({ action: "send", to: "planner", message: "Task-1 complete (15min). Starting Task-2." });
// ... work ...
intercom({ action: "send", to: "planner", message: "Task-2 complete (30min). Task-3 blocked - need API key." });
// ... get unblocked ...
intercom({ action: "send", to: "planner", message: "Task-3 complete. All done." });
```

## Common Workflow: Long-Running Task with Checkpoints

For tasks that might exceed 10 minutes, use send + periodic asks:

```typescript
// 1. Initial send with full context
intercom({
  action: "send",
  to: "worker",
  message: "Implement user authentication. This will take 30+ minutes. I'll check in at milestones."
});

// 2. Worker sends progress via send (no timeout)
intercom({ action: "send", to: "planner", message: "Milestone 1: Login form complete (10min)" });

// 3. Worker asks for specific decision when needed
const decision = await intercom({
  action: "ask",
  to: "planner",
  message: "Should we use JWT or session cookies? Need decision to continue."
});
// Continue with decision...
```
